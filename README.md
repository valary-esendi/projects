here are my projects


I decided that i will solve one problem with defferent programming languages and thus all the projects solve one problem and thats why they look similar but incorparated with different programming languages.


my projects are all about a diet tracker.

 A diet tracker is a digital tool designed to help individuals monitor their food intake, nutritional habits, and overall dietary goals. Users can log their meals and macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats), and analyze their eating patterns.
